# yalu102-space
My fork of yalu102! iOS 10-10.2 jailbreak by @qwertyoruiopz and improved by me!

This is a better version of Yalu with:

A nice UI, more features (and more soon). 

Includes: 

-The ability to enable or disable Substrate, the ability to reinstall Cydia if you messed up

-Will include: The ability to automatically add the nonce to the nvram (as you requested to Lofty)


NOTE from the developer: If you think it may contain malware feel free to check the source code. The purpose of this is to make things easier for newbies (the new options - More for the Reinstall Cydia option. There are people who don't know what SSH means and don't have iFile, Filza or AFC2. This can save jailbreaks. Trust me). If you still think this is unsafe then don't use it. At least don't tell other people to do so. Let them make their decision
